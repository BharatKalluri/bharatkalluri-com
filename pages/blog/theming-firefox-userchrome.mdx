Firefox is heavily customizable. Even after the quantam update, you can theme
firefox to your liking pretty easily. By editing a file called userchrome.css
you could hide and rearrange UI items in firefox pretty easily. `userchrome.css` is a
cascading style sheet that firefox uses to style it's interface. There is a
common misconception that userchrome.css has something to do with chrome. It
actually does not. Firefox had this for a long time and it just happens that
google chrome has the same name.

Now the question is why am I suddenly intrested in tweaking and theming firefox?
I found out that there is a theme for gnome called [Snow](https://github.com/EliverLara/snow)
by EliverLara. This is the same awesome person who made [Ant](https://github.com/EliverLara/Ant). Although Ant is the more popular theme, I happen to like snow because it is a gradient based theme. Even after title bar support, firefox looks very much out of place after theming gnome.

So, Let's fix this! And just for understanding how much firefox can be themed, check out this [elementary firefox](https://github.com/harveycabaguio/firefox-elementary-theme) theme.

First, to find where userchrome.css should be, open up `about:support`. There you will find a entry called profile directory. Click on the open directory button to open your mozilla firefox profile folder. Check if there is a folder named chrome. If not, create a folder named chrome. And inside chrome, create an empty file named userchrome.css.

The first problem to fix is that the window controls should be to the left.
Add the following lines of CSS to userchrome.css ([Source](https://askubuntu.com/a/1035448))

```css
#titlebar-content {
  direction: rtl;
}

#TabsToolbar {
  direction: rtl;
}

#tabbrowser-tabs {
  direction: ltr;
}
```

It looks alright, but there is a large gap between the window controls and the
tabs. Let us fix that too. To edit the userchrome.css and to see changes
dynamically, there are a couple of steps to be done.

* Open the developer by pressing ctrl+shift+I.
* Go to the hamburger menu to open settings and in advanced settings,
and enable browser chrome and add on debugging toolbox and enable remote debugging.
* Open the browser toolbox by clicking ctrl+alt+shift+I.
* Click on the item selecter and hover over to the place you find the spacing
to see which items css should be changed.

On the bottom right, notice that there is a parameter which has a width of 40px.
A width of 15px would be more sutible. Tweak the value to find your sweet spot.
Now right click there and click on `copy rule`. Paste it into your userchrome.css
file and change the value and save the file.

```css
.titlebar-placeholder[type="pre-tabs"], .titlebar-placeholder[type="post-tabs"] {
	width: 15px !important
}

#titlebar-content {
  direction: rtl;
}

#TabsToolbar {
  direction: rtl;
}

#tabbrowser-tabs {
  direction: ltr;
}
```

Restart firefox to see the changes. Now firefox fits well into the desktop.

So, that's how you theme firefox using userchrome.css!
