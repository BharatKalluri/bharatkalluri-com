I come from the fedora land and its been a while since I played around with Ubuntu. Recently I saw a OMG Ubuntu post saying the beta builds
for the next Ubuntu version are out. So I thought I will give it a spin. It has been more than 3 years since I used Ubuntu, this should be interesting. 

I've been testing the Ubuntu groovy gorilla build for a while and although it is a well built Linux distribution. The experience 
feels off. There are a lot of small problems (especially on the UX front) which make it feel like it is not a well thought out system.
I hate to say this but this feels like "death due to a thousand cuts". I think fixing these small issues will greatly enhance the user 
experience. Ubuntu is the flagship distro for Linux, it has the biggest user base and this is usually what gets recommended due to its
large support base. So, we as a Linux community should make sure the first step for people into the Linux world needs to be refined. 

Let me start with what I love.

- I absolutely love the default wallpaper. This is probably the first time I've installed an OS and did not bother changing the wallpaper.
- The theme is ... interesting. It is very different. Windows/Mac OS/Gnome have a more "professional" look to them. Ubuntu's style seems different and fresh.
- They have a dark/light theme switch in the settings!
- The software center comes with snaps pre integrated. This means I can go to the software center, search for slack and hit install. This is great for beginners!
- The desktop is snappy!
- The loading indicator is beautiful
- Everything just works. This is something Ubuntu prides itself on. Stability. And it does deliver.

Now let us discuss my nitpicks. None of these are pointing at Ubuntu specifically, these are what make me pause when I'm using the system.

## Nitpicks

### The carousel is too small in the first page of software center

- [Bug Tracker Link](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-software/+bug/1873945)

I think this is something they will iron out later in the release process. But this bugs me a lot.

### The Editors picks in the software section have applications which do not have an icon
As a desktop user, why would I bother to install an application which does not have an icon? I think the more important question is why
is this an editor pick for Ubuntu desktop?
I understand this is coming from the snap store and there they have cli tools and desktop applications. But I think in the desktop software center
this should not show up in the editor picks.

### Software center should make up its mind on weather it should show up cli tools.

- [Bug Tracker Link](https://bugs.launchpad.net/snap-store-desktop/+bug/1899607)

Search for docker and it shows up as a installable program (The snap shows up), does this means all installable programs are shown? 
No.
Search for GNU stow, it won't show up. But if it is a snap, it will. This is not cohesive. Either it should show all linux installable programs or 
just hide all Command line tools using a settings flag to turn them back on. 
As a end user, I don't care about if an application is a snap or not. I just expect things to be consistent.

### Install percent keeps jumping in software center

- [Bug Tracker Link](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/issues/216)

I think this is related to snap installs. But as a normal end user who does not understand snap/apt installations, this does not look good.
It seems to jump to 14% and then go back to 0% and start from there.

### Snap packages seem to open a different Firefox instance with a different profile (?)

- [Bug Tracker Link](https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1835024)

To be honest I don't fully understand what is causing this. But run a server in VS code snap. Control click the URL and you will notice it opens
up a Firefox instance which does not have any extensions installed. This seems to be a different profile (?). But this is really irritating. The same
thing happens with slack snap as well. But for some reason, postman is not affected by this. But postman has some more weird bugs. Which brings me to the next
point.

### Search results are not ordered by relevance
This is what I see when I search for "spotify"
![spotify search results](/uploads/spotify_app_store.png)

Why is the actual, verified spotify snap so low in the search ordering. It makes it look like it is not the original (but it is).

### Cursors are sometime different between normal applications and snaps

- [Bug Tracker Link](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/8481)

The right of the image is a normally installed application (I don't recall which), the left of the image is postman.
It looks like postman has a different cursor theme altogether.

### Do not disturb toggle transition issue
For some reason, do not disturb toggle has no transition. This is something I noticed on fedora as well. So I'm sure this is a GNOME thing. I don't
think this is intentional.

### Some pre installed applications do not look like they are a part of the system
One of the first program I noticed which felt very inconsistent was "Power settings". 
![Power settings](/uploads/power_settings_sidebar_comp.png)

Here are some more applications still in the GTK 2 design style.
- Software & updates
- Software updater
- Additional Drivers

So it looks like most of the software exclusive to Ubuntu desktop is in its older designs.. Hopefully they will find time to upgrade these.

### The settings in the terminal application looks different from other windows
You might say, that does not look very different. Then I would say, No! It looks very different. Where are the icons to the left! the sidebar 
size is *slightly* bigger. At least for people like me who obsess over design. This bugs me.

### The settings icon in wifi looks squished

### Window previews have too much padding on the right

- [Bug Tracker Link](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-shell-extension-ubuntu-dock/+bug/1899741)

### The right click menu of the dock has too much padding on the right

### After installing a font, the Install button flashes for a very short period of time and then changes to installed

- [Bug Tracker Link](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-font-viewer/-/issues/21)

This is a GNOME Fonts issue which was [already reported here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-font-viewer/-/issues/21). Hopefully they find 
time to fix it.
