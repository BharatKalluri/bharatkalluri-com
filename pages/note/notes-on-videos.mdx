This is a repository of takeaways I've had after watching talks, interviews etc.. If a topic is _really_ broad and
interesting, then that will probably go into a different note.

#### [Scaling from first principles: Sidu Ponnappa (GoJek SVP) edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mQonnU8yBU)

-   Good engineering question to start with while hiring, What is your language of interest, why do you like it? Give a nuanced
    explanation of what you hate in the same language. The idea is that, if someone is experienced in a language. They will
    have the ability to give a long and nuanced answer.
-   Work towards getting "Proof of work" in engineering hiring.
-   Tech budget priority, 1. people budget and 2. infra budget. At a considerable scale, this may equalize.
-   Power, money and people are three pillars of progress for team leaders. Aligning people needs power.
-   Growth is consistently having and showcasing the ability to visualize and deliver/materialize vision.
-   Organization structure drives architecture ([Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)),
    having a frontend and backend team will produce a different architecture than a full stack django/PHP project.
-   Everyone wants to learn, no one wants to study. Surround yourself with people who study.
-   Prioritize evolve-ability over scalability, always.

This interview is gold, a lot of very well thought out takes on different topics.
