I've recently developed a website which continues to average around 100-200 visitors per day. There were a couple of challenges which I will discuss
in a separate post. But one of the harder problems was getting customer feedback. Understanding what users want to see next or to get users to report
when something does not work as expected is much harder than I thought. I think there is an inherent advantage if the user base is tech savvy (This is a guess), 
my target segment is not tech savvy at all and will most probably jump websites if something does not work instead of taking out a minute to report the issue. 

I will go through what I did to get customer feedback, what worked, what did not work and list out other means I want to try out in the future.
