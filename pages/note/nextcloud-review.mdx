This is my review/notes of nextcloud, I've made an attempt to use nextcloud fulltime and get away from the google
"ecosystem". Although the file sync piece is awesome, there is a lot to be desired from almost every other piece.

I'm grateful as everyone else that nextcloud exists, I will try to document all the problems I faced or features I
wished for from nextcloud here.

## Installation

The installation was very simple and straightforward, snap based setup was a breeze. I think this is the golden standard
self hosting software should be aiming to in terms of developer experience.

## App wise notes

### Contacts

-   (+) Importing contacts was a breeze
-   (-) No bulk operations on contacts, feels very weird that something as basic as bulk ops are missing. For some
    reason, google decided to create contacts with just emails(?). I think these are contacts are just used by gmail
    internally. Caused a lot of noise in nextcloud contacts, need to delete them one by one now.
