The initial ideas as of now seem easy since I have already picked them up at school, but its worth revising.

> Most of the code in quotes is basic python.

## Compound interest

-   Simple interest means you earn interest on the invested amount. So for example, Let us say the amount invested is 100
    and the interest is 10% per year. After one year you will have 110 and after one more year you will have 120, since
    the interest is on invested amount. Compound interest on the other hand is on the amount (immaterial of the invested
    amount),so the same example with 10% compounding interest per year would be. `100 + (100*0.1) == 110` after one
    year, and in the second year it will be `110 + (110*0.1) == 121` which can also be written as
    `(100 + (100*0.1)) + ((100 + (100*0.1)) * 0.1) == 110`.
-   The pattern here is: if the initial amount is a, and interest is i. Then amount earned after one unit of time(could be
    month/year/day etc..) is `a + (a*i)` => `a*(1+i)`. Now for the next unit of time, `(a*(1+i)) + ((a*(1+i))*i)` =>
    `a*(1+i)*(1+i)` => `a*((1+i)**2)`. Cool, here is the pattern now. Let us say `n` is the number `a*((1+i)**n)`. So
    plug in `a=1000`, `i=0.1` and `n=5`, then the amount would be `1610.51`.
