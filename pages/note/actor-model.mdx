## What is an actor?
It is a fundamental unit of computation. It has to embody
- Processing
- Storage
- Communication

## Axioms of an actor
On receiving a message, an actor can
- Create some more actors
- Can send messages to another actor
- Designate what it will do with the next message

There is another concept called `Future`. Instead of waiting for a computation to complete, the actor returns back a
future (or an exception) which contains an address to the result which can be passed around. Eventually we reach a
result or an exception state with the future.

An actor can have multiple address and one address can point to multiple actors, so there is a many to many relation
going on here. What that means is that there can be a proxy actor which just forwards the messages to another actor.
