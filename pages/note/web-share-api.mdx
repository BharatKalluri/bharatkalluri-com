With the web share API, web applications can utilize the system provided sharing capabilities. You can even read the [spec](https://w3c.github.io/web-share/) 
in a couple of minutes. 

## Usage

- The site must be served over HTTPS (localhost works for development)
- Currently (as of 13 Oct 2020) the browser support is still not good. Most of the popular mobile browsers support it though.
- The `navigator.share` method has to be called when the user does action (like button click). You cannot call the method directly (for example on page load).
- It can share URLs, text or files

Let us look at an example

```js
if (navigator.share) {
    // Share API available
    navigator.share({
        'title': "BharatKalluri.in",
        "url": "https://bharatkalluri.in"
    })
        .then(()=>console.log("Shared successfully"))
        .catch((err)=>console.log(err))
} else {
    // Fallback
}
```

`navigator.share` needs at least on of the following parameters: `title`, `text`, `url` or `files`. Desktop browsers largely lack support
for the API. So a fall back is necessary.

That's about it, hopefully support for this API will land on all major browsers soon.
