I've been trying to get rid of all the dependencies which I have on google for a while. Tried nextcloud a while back
but did not stick to it (for some reason, I don't seem to recollect). After lurking and listening to some conversations
over at the foss united telegram group, I thought I would give nextcloud another shot.

I have completely migrated away from google drive and photos as of now and am in the process of migrating my personal
calender and contacts. So far it has been a good experience. This is just a brain dump of all the steps to setup
nextcloud. There is more work todo for later, but this is a good starting point.

Personally I wanted a `iCloud` kind of a service rather than a `GSuite` kind of a service. On the face of it, nextcloud
seems to do a lot more things. And in the process a lot of the
pieces do not seem very polished. I will be writing a more detailed review on what I liked and disliked about nextcloud
sometime later.

Disclaimer, A lot of companies offer nextcloud as a service. If nextcloud is the only service you want to be hosting and
you are okay with the idea of hosted services, that should be what you should be looking at. I use Hetzner as my cloud
provider, looks like [Hetzner provides nextcloud as a service](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-share). For 100GB
they charge 3.36 € (around 300 rupees).

## The domain, DNS setup, getting the instance and the total yearly cost

I bought my domain from Namecheap, I pay ₹653 for the domain per year. The blog you are looking at is hosted on Vercel.
So all the DNS is managed out of Vercel as of now. I bought the server from Hetzner, the server costs around 2.89 €
which is around ₹259 per month. The system has a 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB disk space and 20TB traffic transfer. So the
instance costs around ₹3120 per year. After the instance is up, the DNS of the domain needs to point to the public IP of
of your instance. I am pointing the subdomain (`cloud.bharatkalluri.com`) to the IP of the instance.

Summing it all up, it costs me around ₹3773(`3120 + 653 = 3773`) per year if I self host nextcloud + blog.

## System setup and installing nextcloud

Hetzner drops us into the root user by default. So let us create a user. As usual, replace whatever is in the pointy
brackets with your details.

```bash
# Creating a user and making the user an admin
sudo useradd -m <username>
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
# Setting a password for <username>
sudo passwd <username>
```

Also, set a password for root.

```bash
sudo passwd root
```

Log out of the SSH session, log in back with the `ssh <username>@<instance IP>`. For some reason, Hetzner instances
start with an `sh` shell. So, I am going to install my preferred shell, `zsh`.

```bash
# Installing some prerequisites for oh my zsh
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install git zsh -y
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Now, setting up a basic firewall using `ufw`.

```bash
# Setup basic firewall rules
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow https
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw enable
```

Installing nextcloud. If the instance is running ubuntu, `snapd` will already be pre installed. If you are running any
other operating system, find the instructions to install snapd [here](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd).

```bash
# Install nextcloud
sudo snap install nextcloud
sudo nextcloud.manual-install <username> <password>
sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=<your-domain.name>
sudo nextcloud.enable-https lets-encrypt
```

nextcloud generates a letsencrypt certificate for your domain and sets it up for https. Now you should be able to hit
`<your-domain-name>` and see nextcloud running.

## What next

-   **Reverse proxy-ing:** Currently there is no proxy sitting in front of nextcloud, so the instance is pretty much reserved for nextcloud. I will
    be wanting to host more services in the future. I should setup a reverse proxy (like HAProxy/Nginx).
-   **Backups:** Currently there is absoluetly no backups setup. I will be setting up instance level snapshots and linux
    backups sometime soon.
