**Status: Brewing**

I've always hoarded URL's to read, Movies and series to watch, books to read, games to play, twitter threads to archive etc.. The problem is that
there is no clean central place to do this. 

The idea of this platform would be a one stop shop where you can dump different kinds of links. This service will figure out the domain. We will have custom plugins
for domains. And if we have an integration, we will populate extra information/data. Let me explain

- If you drop and IMDB/Rotten tomatoes link. Maybe the service will figure out the movie, get its ratings and show it as a thumbnail with the poster
- If you drop in a twitter thread, it will compile all the tweets in a readable thread format and lay it out for you.
- If you drop in a normal web link, it will get the article contents and show it.
- If you drop in a spotify link, it will fetch the artist / album info and show it as well.

This could go on and on. 

One more very important feature is that it should be very easy to share stuff to this service, and it should be entirely cross platform. So the service will also
have a telegram bot to which you can push links and later tag and classify them. One you are done, you can archive them as usual. 

People should also have an option to set their bookmarks to public. I think this can be at per URL level. Users should also have the feature to share their profile details and see the public bookmarks.

Sometimes I want to read about a topic, but don't know where I have to look it up etc.. There should be some simple note support so that I can dump in
a topic name and some notes and later research and make bookmarks.

API should be a first class citizen. Everything should be script-able from day one. Sync between websites could be a thing. All the saved links in pocket
could appear in #pocket. All the loved tweets can appear in #twitter.

### UI

Just one big board of content (Something similar to Pinterest). 

Each card will contain 
- Title
- Description (If any)
- Image (Either from open graph tags or a screen shot of the website at that time)
- URL
- Tags (Clickable)

An option to multiple select and do bulk actions.

On click, There will be a new page opened which will have three tabs. First tab will be the web view, second will be the processed view and the third will be the 
metadata view.

I will try to create a functional prototype using something like figma sometime soon..

### External Services I can think of

- Twitter threads (replace unroll/threaded)
- IMDB (Thumbnails can have rating to the lower bottom)
- Rotten tomatoes (Thumbnails can have rating to the bottom)
- Reader view for articles (Check out [readability by mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/readability))
- Youtube videos can have video length. (Maybe likes and dislikes count as well?)
- Shazam songs can have corresponding youtube / spotify links (?)

### Challenges:

This is too early to think of challenges, but here are some thoughts running in my head as of now.

- Auth will be firebase. Need to figure out how I can authenticate users from telegram.
- Have multiple helper services, which hit external APIs like twitter, IMDB, Goodreads etc..

### Literature

- [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io) : Nailed the UI piece. Fetches thumbnails for IMDB etc..
- [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) : Extremely crossplatform. Has reader view/dark mode etc.. The UI is not very appealing I feel. 
- [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) : One of the most simplest bookmarking service. Charges a one time fee of 22$.
