title: Understanding the VCF format for contact storage and transfer
publishedAt: "2021-01-01"

This is also called as the vCard format. The spec is located on the IETF website
([rfc6350](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350)). The complete spec is 75 pages! 75 pages of rules defining how to store
contact information!

## Wait, why are you doing this to yourself?

Specs are interesting, a group of people took upon a task of forming a set of rules for defining how contacts should be
stored and transferred throughout multiple organizations. This sounds like a tremendously hard task (and it is). There
must have been a lot of research done before deciding on a specification meant for the world.

Specs also show the breadth and depth of the problem. They showcase pieces which you and I might not think of. I think
this also helps in appreciating the complexity of the problem.

I thought a good starting point for me would be a spec of a standard which is not too complicated. So I picked up the
vCard spec. Well, turns out what I expected to happen was wrong. This spec is 75 pages! But then, I can't back down now.
So here is what I have been able to get out reading the spec. Hope you also find this interesting.

## Notes while reading the spec

-   mime type: `text/vcard`. Can contain one contact or a group of contacts
-   lines are delimited by line breaks, which is a CRLF sequence (U+000D followed by U+000A)
-   Line folding _should_ be done at 75 octets (75 letters? since octets is 8 bits = byte?). Folding can be done by
    inserting a CRLF immediately followed by a single white space character (space (U+0020) or horizontal tab (U+0009))
-   The spec uses ABNF Format Definition ([which has its own spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234), a shorter
    description can be [found on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form)). This
    could take time, but is a pretty powerful way of representing rules. Here is the complete vCard spec in ABNF

```
vcard-entity = 1*vcard

vcard = "BEGIN:VCARD" CRLF
        "VERSION:4.0" CRLF
        1*contentline
        "END:VCARD" CRLF
    ; A vCard object MUST include the VERSION and FN properties.
    ; VERSION MUST come immediately after BEGIN:VCARD.
contentline = [group "."] name *(";" param) ":" value CRLF
    ; When parsing a content line, folded lines must first
    ; be unfolded according to the unfolding procedure
    ; described in Section 3.2.
    ; When generating a content line, lines longer than 75
    ; characters SHOULD be folded according to the folding
    ; procedure described in Section 3.2.

group = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
name  = "SOURCE" / "KIND" / "FN" / "N" / "NICKNAME"
        / "PHOTO" / "BDAY" / "ANNIVERSARY" / "GENDER" / "ADR" / "TEL"
        / "EMAIL" / "IMPP" / "LANG" / "TZ" / "GEO" / "TITLE" / "ROLE"
        / "LOGO" / "ORG" / "MEMBER" / "RELATED" / "CATEGORIES"
        / "NOTE" / "PRODID" / "REV" / "SOUND" / "UID" / "CLIENTPIDMAP"
        / "URL" / "KEY" / "FBURL" / "CALADRURI" / "CALURI" / "XML"
        / iana-token / x-name
    ; Parsing of the param and value is based on the "name" as
    ; defined in ABNF sections below.
    ; Group and name are case-insensitive.

iana-token = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
    ; identifier registered with IANA

x-name = "x-" 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
    ; Names that begin with "x-" or "X-" are
    ; reserved for experimental use, not intended for released
    ; products, or for use in bilateral agreements.

param = language-param / value-param / pref-param / pid-param
        / type-param / geo-parameter / tz-parameter / sort-as-param
        / calscale-param / any-param
    ; Allowed parameters depend on property name.

param-value = *SAFE-CHAR / DQUOTE *QSAFE-CHAR DQUOTE

any-param  = (iana-token / x-name) "=" param-value *("," param-value)

NON-ASCII = UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
    ; UTF8-{2,3,4} are defined in [RFC3629]

QSAFE-CHAR = WSP / "!" / %x23-7E / NON-ASCII
    ; Any character except CTLs, DQUOTE

SAFE-CHAR = WSP / "!" / %x23-39 / %x3C-7E / NON-ASCII
    ; Any character except CTLs, DQUOTE, ";", ":"

VALUE-CHAR = WSP / VCHAR / NON-ASCII
    ; Any textual character
```

-   Folding and unfolding is a critical piece. A line that begins with a white space character is a continuation of
    the previous line and should be treated accordingly.
-   Here is the ABNF spec for `value`

```
value = text
    / text-list
    / date-list
    / time-list
    / date-time-list
    / date-and-or-time-list
    / timestamp-list
    / boolean
    / integer-list
    / float-list
    / URI               ; from Section 3 of [RFC3986]
    / utc-offset
    / Language-Tag
    / iana-valuespec
; Actual value type depends on property name and VALUE parameter.
text = *TEXT-CHAR

TEXT-CHAR = "\\" / "\," / "\n" / WSP / NON-ASCII
        / %x21-2B / %x2D-5B / %x5D-7E
; Backslashes, commas, and newlines must be encoded.

component = "\\" / "\," / "\;" / "\n" / WSP / NON-ASCII
        / %x21-2B / %x2D-3A / %x3C-5B / %x5D-7E
list-component = component *("," component)

text-list             = text             *("," text)
date-list             = date             *("," date)
time-list             = time             *("," time)
date-time-list        = date-time        *("," date-time)
date-and-or-time-list = date-and-or-time *("," date-and-or-time)
timestamp-list        = timestamp        *("," timestamp)
integer-list          = integer          *("," integer)
float-list            = float            *("," float)

boolean = "TRUE" / "FALSE"
integer = [sign] 1*DIGIT
float   = [sign] 1*DIGIT ["." 1*DIGIT]

sign = "+" / "-"

year   = 4DIGIT  ; 0000-9999
month  = 2DIGIT  ; 01-12
day    = 2DIGIT  ; 01-28/29/30/31 depending on month and leap year
hour   = 2DIGIT  ; 00-23
minute = 2DIGIT  ; 00-59
second = 2DIGIT  ; 00-58/59/60 depending on leap second
zone   = utc-designator / utc-offset
utc-designator = %x5A  ; uppercase "Z"

date          = year    [month  day]
            / year "-" month
            / "--"     month [day]
            / "--"      "-"   day
date-noreduc  = year     month  day
            / "--"     month  day
            / "--"      "-"   day
date-complete = year     month  day

time          = hour [minute [second]] [zone]
            /  "-"  minute [second]  [zone]
            /  "-"   "-"    second   [zone]
time-notrunc  = hour [minute [second]] [zone]
time-complete = hour  minute  second   [zone]
    time-designator = %x54  ; uppercase "T"
date-time = date-noreduc  time-designator time-notrunc
timestamp = date-complete time-designator time-complete

date-and-or-time = date-time / date / time-designator time

utc-offset = sign hour [minute]

Language-Tag = <Language-Tag, defined in [RFC5646], Section 2.1>

iana-valuespec = <value-spec, see Section 12>
            ; a publicly defined valuetype format, registered
            ; with IANA, as defined in Section 12 of this
            ; document.
```

All of this is to say the value can take a bunch of values. Different dates, timestamps with offsets, normal text etc..

-   `param` can take on multiple values as values as well
-   vCard properties are the most interesting and important component. There are
    -   5 general properties (`BEGIN, END, SOURCE, KIND, XML`)
    -   7 user identification properties (`FN, N, NICKNAME, PHOTO, BDAY, ANNIVERSARY, GENDER`)
    -   1 user address property (`ADR`)
    -   4 user communication properties (`TEL, EMAIL, IMPP, LANG`)
    -   2 user geo properties (TZ, GEO)
    -   6 user organization properties (`TITLE, ROLE, LOGO, ORG, MEMBER, RELATED`)
    -   7 explanatory properties (`CATEGORIES, NOTE, PRODID, REV, SOUND, UID, CLIENTPIDMAP, URL, VERSION`)
    -   1 security propery (`KEY`)
    -   3 calendar properties (`FBURL, CALADURI, CALURI`)
    -   And some extended properties and parameters (begin with `X-` and can be an defined bilaterally between two
        agents)

I can talk about each one of them individually, but then I will just be making a copy of the spec. So if you have
questions, I suggest you go through that piece of the spec to clarify your questions.
