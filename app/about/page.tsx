					Hey and welcome! Iâ€™m a Software developer working in a fin-tech startup called Refyne in India. In
					my free time I make things in Python, Node js or Golang.
				</p>
				<p>
					This blog is a collection of what I have managed to learn during my experiments. My hobbies include
					reading books, Photography and Playing computer games. Most of my personal projects can be found on
					github.

					Also, feel free to
					<CustomLink href={'https://cal.com/bharatkalluri'}> schedule a call with me </CustomLink>
					if you want to talk about tech, programming, open source, movies, books, TV series, philosophy and
					everything in between :)
