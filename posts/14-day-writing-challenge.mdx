# Writers block

I think I've hit the writers block. It's been a very long while since I've written anything substantial. This could also be partly due to the fact that finding time for exploratory side projects is becoming hard. Could also be because the bar is set too high, and the idea of publishing flushed out articles is overrated.

Usually people recommend starting a challenge at this point of the journey. A challenge will setup constraints and make sure that something gets shipped. The notes section was particularly setup for this purpose. To allow free form unstructured writing, the challenge now is to write for fourteen days straight. No topic restrictions.
