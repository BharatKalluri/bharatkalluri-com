Books have been around for a _very, very long time_. Identifying books using a unique identifier is very beneficial
for a lot of reasons. In identifying duplicates in a library/catalog, querying if a book exists etc… So naturally,
organizations around the world have tried to standardize this identification process.

> Quickly setting up some nomenclature, a book/work (Angels and demons) can have multiple editions (hard copy,
audiobook). Each edition technically needs to have its own identifier. Apart from books, there are many more types
of print media(text books, magazines, newspapers etc…)

## ISBN

The infamous original standard for book identification. ISBN stands for International Standard Book Number, the
International ISBN agency assigns the unique identifier. Every edition gets its own ISBN, which means a paperback,
hard cover, PDF e-book and an epub e-book of the same book will have different ISBNs. But re printings will not be
assigned with a new ISBN.Method of assigning ISBNs is also country specific. Organizations might need to
[pay to get a ISBN](https://www.isbn-international.org/content/how-get-isbn). Apparently to get one ISBN, it costs
$125 and 10 costs $295 ([source](https://www.myidentifiers.com/identify-protect-your-book/isbn/buy-isbn)).
Getting one ISBN does not make sense since usually any published book will at least have a
paperback and a couple of ebook versions (pdf, epub, mobi etc...), so I think 10 is the default sensible choice for
publishers.

In 1970, ISO came up with the first version of ISBN called ISBN 10 informally, since it used to contain 10 digits.
Later on, there was a revision and every ISBN after 2007 Jan 1 has 13 digits. This is informally called as ISBN-13.
International Standards Organization (ISO) had to increase the size of ISBN since they were starting to see signs
that 10 digits
[will not be enough to keep up](https://web.archive.org/web/20070610160919/http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/iso/tc46sc9/isbn.htm#Capacity)
with the pace of the books published in different formats.

An ISBN-10 is converted to ISBN-13 by prepending "978" to the ISBN-10 and recalculating the final
checksum digit using the ISBN-13 algorithm. The reverse process can also be performed, if they start with 978. Else
those records have no ISBN 10.

#### Pain points

Like any other global mutually agreed upon standard, there are issues and inconsistencies with ISBN too. Here are some

- The book is self-published and did not attempt to get an ISBN. Hence, does not have one.
- The book is very old and ISBN system did not exist back then
- Multiple books can have the same ISBN! (For example, ISBN 0-590-76484-5 is shared by two books – Ninja gaiden: a
    novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo (1990) and Wacky laws (1997), both published by Scholastic.)
- One edition can have multiple ISBNs
- Need to fact-check, but apparently 43% of ebooks published on Amazon do not have an ISBN
[(source)](https://www.editage.com/info/book-editing-services/articles/10-faqs-on-isbn-every-self-publishing-author-must-know).
If someone wants to self-publish in multiple ebook formats, I can imagine the author not opting in for an
ISBN since it can be pretty expensive

## ASIN

ASIN stands for Amazon Standard Identification Number. Its a 10 digit unique identification number given to every
product on Amazon. This includes all kinds of books as well.

This is not a standard. If a book is not listed on Amazon, it won't have an ASIN. On the flip side, Amazon does not
make it mandatory that all books need to have ISBNs, so if book is only published on Amazon. The only credible
identifier for that work would be ASIN.

## OCLC/WorldCat ID

WorldCat is said to be the world's largest library catalog. Every book listed there gets its own identifier.

## Other identifiers from book data aggregators

Every book data aggregator has their own identification numbering. For example, here are some aggregators

- [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)
- [Openlibrary](https://openlibrary.org)
- [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/)
