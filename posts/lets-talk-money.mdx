I was in search of good starter books related to personal finance. This was one of the best books I've read which summarizes the fundamentals beautifully. Highly recommended.

Here are some of my notes

### General Financial Planning
1. Split money into three accounts: Income, Spending, and Saving.
2. Maintain an emergency fund equal to 6 months of living costs, potentially in a fixed deposit or a liquid form.

### Medical Insurance
3. Ensure robust medical cover of at least 20 lakhs per person.
4. Evaluate medical cover based on price, benefits, and claim processes.
5. Acknowledge that medical cover prices will fluctuate annually and ensure both current and future prices are reasonable.

### Medical Policy Checkpoints
6. Ensure the policy doesn’t have a "Copay" clause.
7. Investigate pre-existing disease clauses and their corresponding "Cooling" period (Note: "Kulav" seems to be a typo or an unfamiliar term, assuming you meant a type of waiting period).
8. Check if the policy includes a “Disease Waiting” period.
9. Investigate if the policy applies sub-limits.
10. Look for any exclusions.
11. Inquire about the coverage for pre and post-hospitalization costs.
12. Request a list of daycare procedures that don't require a 24-hour stay.
13. Evaluate the no-claim bonus feature.

### Claims & Complaints
14. Investigate claims data and select a policy with fewer than 30 complaints per 10,000 claims (avoid focusing on percentages).
15. Be mindful that companies might group individual and group claims, with the latter often having a higher claim rate.

### Additional Covers
16. Purchase critical illness and accident covers as added protection.

### Investment Tips
17. Use the rule of 72: If your money doubles in X years, divide 72 by X to find the annual return rate.
18. Avoid resorting to endowment plans.

### Life Insurance
19. Aim for a cover that's 8-10 times your annual income or 15-20 times your annualized monthly expenditure.

### Debt Management
20. Whenever taking a large loan, secure a term cover for the full amount of the debt.

### Timing and Type of Insurance
21. Buy insurance as soon as you have or anticipate having dependents.
22. The younger you are, the cheaper your premiums will likely be.
23. Opt for term cover and avoid other complex insurance products.

### Investment Mindset
24. Do not delay investing due to a lack of a large corpus - start early.
25. Remember: be an investor, not a trader.
26. Establishing an emergency fund and obtaining insurance are strategies to safeguard your finances against unforeseen events, akin to a financial seatbelt.
