Recently I have been on the lookout for good personal finance books. Books which serve as a succinct introduction to managing personal finances which I can recommend to friends and family. I've been hearing about two books frequently coined, one was [Let's talk money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40499078-let-s-talk-money) and the other was [Money Wise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59463301-money-wise)

The book has absolutely great pacing and structure, starts with investment instruments which are absolute essentials and keeps progressively going towards more good to have instruments like mutual funds towards the end. Each class gets its own chapter and she does a great job of beautifully explaining the dynamics of the industry and how you can plan and use the class in your portfolio of savings

She introduces a concept of money box in which there are about nine classes of instruments. And in each instrument you can choose to either invest a certain amount or take a call to not invest. The idea is to have a comprehensive understanding of the options available so that we can take educated calls

> These are my own notes, the book offers much more than this. If you find these notes useful, definitely go buy the book and read it. Its one of the most accessible and well written finance books I've read

## Notes

- Personally I already had knowledge in stock markets & mutual funds. The first couple of chapters have been very educational as she covers medical cover and insurance which I did not have depth in before. I've found this very interesting
- Split money into three accounts. Income, spending and saving
- Keep aside 6 months of living costs including everything in it as an emergency fund
- The emergency fund can be a fixed deposit. It needs to be liquid all the time
- Get a good medical cover. You'll need a basic medical cover for at least 20 lakhs per person
- Judge a medical cover by three factors price, benefits and claims
- The price of the medical cover is going to change every year. Make sure that the current price and the future price are in a good boundary
- Some things to check before taking your policy. Full stop. Policy should not have a "Co-pay" clause. Check for pre-existing disease clauses. And the corresponding cool off period. Check if your policy has a "Disease Waiting" period. Check if your policy has sub-limits. Check for exclusions. Ask how much of the costs before and after hospitalization the policy will cover. Ask for a list of daycare procedures that don't need you to stay for 24 hours. Look at the no-claim bonus feature
- Make sure you look into claims data before buying the medical cover. Companies sometimes club group claims and individual claims. Group claims usually have a much higher claim rate. Look at the claim complaints data and look for a policy that has less than 30 complaints on every 10,000 claims made. Do not look at percentages. Always look at absolutes. Also, buy critical illness and accident cover value added
- The rule of 72 to know the rate of return every year of a double your money proposition simply ask the question Over what time does my money double then divide 72 by that number? Suppose the agent says your one lakh will grow to two lakhs in 15 years divide 72 by 15 Your return per year is 4.8% percentage
- Do not resort to endowment plans
- The rule of thumb is that you need 8 to 10 times here take home annual income as a cover. This is for life insurance or 15 to 20 times your annualized monthly expenditure
- In addition to cover for your income you need to buy insurance for all the debt you have each time you take a large loan Make sure you buy a term cover for the full amount of the 
- Regarding when's a good time to buy: buy as soon as you have dependents or the possibility of getting dependents arises The younger you are the cheaper you're looking for The cover you get is a multiple of what you want. 
- Just get a term cover. Nothing else. 
- Not beginning process of investing because you don't have a large corpus in the first place is like waiting to get fit before you join a diet and fitness routine. Remember we are investors not traders
- Setting up an emergency fund and buying insurance covers are ways to protect or money box from unavoidable events as your journey through life and to reduce the damage to your financial static financial seatbelt doesn't think it reduces the need to keep most of the money ready at hand

### The money box

I really liked this crystallized structure of thinking about personal finances

- Cashflow cell : Three bank accounts: salary, spends & savings
- Emergency cell: Money you'll need in a hurry (within a week or 10 days). FDs & mutual funds for this cell
- Medical insurance cell: Get help from a financial planner to find the best plan for you if needed here
- Life insurance cell: Term plan to cover for untimely death
- Almost there cell: Investments for needs that are two to three years in the future. Either FDs or short term mutual funds for this cell
- In some time investments: Investments for needs for three to seven years. Mutual funds fit here too
- Far away cell: Goals other than retirement. 100% equity mutual funds for this cell
- Retirement cell: PF & PPF and rest in equity funds if you can afford some risk. This is to build up for freedom in retirement
- Gold and real estate: Suggested not more than 5-10% of total portfolio in gold. Real estate can get pretty messy, suggested to keep it down to the house you live in
