## Why

I've recently recognized that I am subscribed to _200 channels on youtube!_, 200 channels I have subscribed since I
started my google account (which is around 10 years back). I think at this point, there is more noise than signal. So I
thought it's time to hit the reset button.

The idea is that, I will remember the channels which matter to me and re-subscribe.

## How

My initial idea was to do it via a python script using the youtube API. But I thought this is a complex solution for a
very simple problem. Then I looked into the API requests from youtube websites to see if there is any pattern I can
observe and take advantage of. Did not find anything easy there as well. The easiest way to achieve this would be just
to stimulate what I do manually, go click on un-subscribe and confirm the un-subscription. This can be done with a
simple javascript snippet which can be pasted directly in the JS console.

To see all the channels you are subscribed to, [go to this link](https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels). To unsubscribe,
first click is on the "SUBSCRIBED" button and after a small animation, a modal pops up. The "UNSUBSCRIBE". Since there
are two steps, it makes the script slightly complex. Here is the script

```javascript
unSubBtnList = document.querySelectorAll("[aria-label^='Unsubscribe from']");
for (let i = 0; i < unSubBtnList.length; i++) {
	setTimeout(() => {
		unSubBtnList[i].click();
	}, 1000);

	setTimeout(() => {
		document.querySelector('[aria-label="Unsubscribe"]').click();
	}, 1000);
}
```

`aria-label` is used for accessability purposes. I assume this is something youtube does not change often, so this
script should work for a while. The sample aria label would be `aria-label="Unsubscribe from Lex Fridman."`. The pattern
here is that they all start with `Unsubscribe from`. So we retrieve all the buttons, iterate over them. Click the
button, wait for a second for the modal animation to complete, search for another button called Unsubscribe and click
that button.
