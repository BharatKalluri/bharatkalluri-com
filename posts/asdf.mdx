ASDF is a extendable version manager which supports [python](https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python),
[ruby](https://github.com › asdf-vm › asdf-ruby), [golang](https://github.com/kennyp/asdf-golang),
[Elixr](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir), [rust](Rust plugin for the asdf version manager) and
[many others](https://asdf-vm.com/#/plugins-all?id=plugin-list).

Usually when working on multiple projects, you will not only probably need support for different languages but also be
required to run multiple versions of the same language. I have a couple of NodeJS projects which run on the LTS version
and some other projects run on the latest release.

To solve this problem, there are projects like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) which manages NodeJS versions. Python
also has [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for managing python versions. If you are a polyglot programmer, this
won't scale well and you'll be left with a lot of version managers. The first version manager I used is `NVM`, later
installed `pyenv` for python and `rustup` for Rust. This start getting tedious real fast.

## ASDF

ASDF VM (VM stands for version manager here, not virtual machine) is a beautifully simple version manager which allows
having _global version and directory specific versions_ for tools. ASDF codebase does not internally have code for any
tool or language. It is more of a meta tool which will utilize code from
plugins and orchestrate version management. To install a particular tool, the first step would be to install the
corresponding plugin.

To see what tools can be installed using asdf, run `plugin list all`

```shell
asdf plugin list all
```

### Installing NodeJS with ASDF

Step one would be to add the nodejs plugin.

```shell
asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
```

before setting up a version as a global version, that particular version needs to be installed. Here is how the latest
nodejs version can be installed

```shell
asdf install nodejs latest
```

Now it can be set to be the global version

```shell
asdf global nodejs latest
```

When you do `where node`, the output will be `~/.asdf/shims/node`. And `node --version` will show `v16.11.1` (the
current latest version).

Let us assume another project cannot run on the latest node version yet, and expects to be run on the LTS version(14.18
as of now). In that case all that needs to be done is

```shell
cd bharatkalluri.com # As an example, I'm using the blog's git repo as the project
asdf install nodejs 14.18.1
asdf local nodejs 14.18.1
```

and now `node --version` will output `14.18.1` and everywhere else node will default back to the latest 16.11.1

That is the power of using a version manager. This will heavily simplify the entire process of managing multiple
versions of the same languages.

The same steps can be repeated for python, ruby, rust, elixir, erlang etc... ASDF supports most of the popular programming
languages and many other tools! (to see what it supports, run `asdf plugin list all`)

## What's in the box!

How does all this work?

Let's start exploring from the global version. If you look at the home folder, you will find a file called `.tool-versions`.
In my case, this is what it says

```shell
nodejs 16.11.1
python 3.10.0
rust 1.55.0
```

So this is what defines what the global version of multiple installed tools. If a local version is set up for a directory,
there is a file created called `.tool-versions` in the directory which has the language and the version. So this is how
ASDF understands what version to use where.

But how does the installation of plugins work? And where are these download versions stored?

## How do plugins work?

To understand that, let us look at how plugins are created. There is great documentation over
[here](http://asdf-vm.com/plugins/create.html)

Looks like ASDF expects 3 fundamental scripts, `bin/list-all`, `bin/download` and `bin/install`. As the name says,
they are simple scripts which just do one thing and one thing well.

Let us look at the [bat plugin](https://gitlab.com/wt0f/asdf-bat) to understand what is actually going on. `bat` is an
alternative to `cat` written in rust. It is just a simple binary, this makes it easier to understand how ASDF internally works.

In the `list-all` file, a fn called `list-all-versions` is called. Which basically runs this command

```shell
git ls-remote --tags --refs "https://github.com/sharkdp/bat" |
    grep -o 'refs/tags/.*' | cut -d/ -f3- |
    sed 's/^v//'
```

This command gets all the tags that repo has, searches, cuts and displays the releases versions. So that is how versions
are listed when the command `asdf list all bat` (`asdf list all <tool_name_here>`) works.

Now, to the `install` script. The `install` script I'm referring to lives [here](https://gitlab.com/wt0f/asdf-bat/-/blob/master/bin/install)

A couple of points to note here before I jump in. ASDF passes on some env variables which are heavily used during any installations.
Let's suppose I run `asdf install bat 0.12.1`, then ASDF sets the `$ASDF_INSTALL_PATH` to `~/.asdf/installs/bat/0.12.1`.
This is where the files are stored. Here is the core fn which runs the `install`

```shell
install_bat() {
  local version=$2
  local install_path=$3
  local bin_install_path="$install_path/bin"
  local download_url; download_url="$(get_download_url "$version")"

  mkdir -p "${bin_install_path}"

  local bin_path="${bin_install_path}/bat"
  echo "Downloading bat from ${download_url}"
  curl -sSL "$download_url" -o "${install_path}/bat.tar.gz"
  tar xzf "${install_path}/bat.tar.gz" -C "${install_path}"
  mv "${install_path}/bat-v${version}-$(get_arch)-$(get_platform)"/* "${install_path}"
  mv "${install_path}/bat" "${bin_path}"
  chmod +x "$bin_path"
  rm -rf "${install_path}/bat.tar.gz" "${install_path}"/bat-*
}

```

The version and the installation path come from ASDF. There is also a custom bin install path set. This will be useful
later on. The download URL is retrieved using a simple custom function which takes in the version, arch and the platform.
Creates a GitHub URL and downloads that tar file. That tar file is later un compressed and the `bat` binary is moved
to the bin folder.

The reason the bin path is important is that, ASDF [creates a shim by default](http://asdf-vm.com/plugins/create.html#environment-variables)
for everything in `$install_path/bin`.

### What exactly is a shim?

> A shim is a lib that transparently intercepts and handles all the operations elsewhere.

So, `which bat` says `~/.asdf/shims/bat`. But the binary is just a placeholder to the actual binary over at the installation
path!

This was an overview of how ASDF internally works to manage multiple versions of tools. Thanks for sticking around till
the end!
