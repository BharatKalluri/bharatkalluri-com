> This is a living document, I'll keep adding ideas when I find them. Feel free to pick them up and let me know if it has been done!

### PDF compresser

Reference: [SnazzyLabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2xoRkzjQoc&t=1110s) recommends [PDF squeezer](https://www.witt-software.com/pdfsqueezer)

A simple application which takes in a PDF and a level for compressing, compresses the pdf and shows the reduction amount.

### Window management app based on shortcuts

Reference: [Magnet](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle)

App which has shortcuts for moving the window to particular position based on shortcuts. I use magnet a lot when I'm on MacOS. It is super
convienent to just press a key and move the window to a particular position.
