Every company/website wants your email Id these days, to "engage with their customers".
Which most probably implies that they will spam your inbox with useless emails. And
if you are like me, and will enroll on every website remotely interesting found on
product hunt, Twitter or Reddit. Pretty soon there will be more than 5k emails in
the inbox. Cleaning up an inbox is hard and will take time. But cleaning up is very
important because there is a possibility of you losing important email in the noise.
Apparently there are a couple of websites which help in doing this. Mail storm and
unroll.me are two such services which come to mind. But they have some limitations
on the free versions. Mail storm charges somewhere between 50$ to 200$ per year for
their pro service. I would never pay so much for that. Also there is a much bigger
problem, *privacy*. Unroll.me was caught [stealing personal email data](https://theintercept.com/2017/04/24/stop-using-unroll-me-right-now-it-sold-your-data-to-uber/)
. I don't think it is wise to disclose all emails to any private entity (That is
why all my personal email is on Protonmail, I believe they do a good job on the privacy
front). Mail sanitizer was born out of this frustration. The idea is simple - Authenticate
the user using Google auth - Get all the emails of the user and store them locally
in a file - Scan through all the from fields and get a list of the mail sender's
sorted by the count of emails they sent - Try to get an unsubscribe link from headers
of the email - Present this data to the user, saying X has sent 400 emails, would
you like to unsubscribe. And the second question would be, go you want to delete
all these emails. Based on the answers we take the necessary actions. This should
be a simple command line program which will heavily simplify mail cleanup. After
some nice colors and emojis, we'll have a clean, useful and usable command line application.
In the future, we might add - Support for other email providers - Having a web interface
for more ease of use
