This article also evolves as my job evolves. Currently I do mostly Python and Typescript, So all the tooling will be focused on those languages.

### Getting started

-   Go through all the steps of Mac setup like setting up time zone etc..
-   Update your system so that you have all the security updates and patches

### Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for Mac OS. If you are familiar with apt on ubuntu or dnf on fedora, you will feel right at home. Install homebrew from command line

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### Install Apps

Brew broadly has two types of apps, normal open source applications like git etc.. and binary applications like firefox as casks. So `brew install git` installs git and `brew cask install firefox` installs firefox since firefox is a binary.

```shell
brew install \
  git \
  gpg \
  gawk \
  fzf \
  stow \
  exa \
  git-delta \
  make
```

Now let us install casks

```shell
brew install --cask \
  alfred \
  telegram \
  visual-studio-code \
  firefox \
  rectangle \
  iterm2 \
  docker \
  iina \
  spotify \
  postman \
  jetbrains-toolbox \
  zoom \
  slack \
  bitwarden \
  whatsapp
```

### Shell

MacOS already comes with zsh as the default shell, install oh-my-zsh which comes with a range of plugins and themes.

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### SSH

Generate ssh keys and add them to github/gitlab

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<email>"
```

### Safari extensions

Safari is a good browser and a sane default, but it requires some extensions for it to be ready for day to day use.

Safari extensions to install

-   Enable Bitwarden on safari
-   Adguard

### Changes in MacOS settings and tweaks in other applications

-   Enable tap on click on touch pad at Track pad > Tap to click
-   Change caps lock to escape key : Keyboard > modifier keys > Caps lock - escape
-   Set dark mode
-   Dock preferences > Automatically hide and show dock
-   Turn on firewall
-   Change to natural preset for keyboard in `iterm`
-   Change `iterm` theme to smooth and appearance to minimal
