If there are two apps which I'll definitely need to work, those would be my tasks app and calendar. I've never been particularly happy with any planning software, am not really sure why. I'm so irritated at this point that I feel like building my own thing. Let me explain.

## Calendar as a tasks application

Every calendar is also a tasks application. Since every event is technically a task. Just that an event has a _probability of occurrence_.

A probability of occurrence can be a one if event is pre scheduled and is definitely going to happen. Some self set events will happen sometime in a time range, and then eventually will happen at a particular time. Hence the event will sort of collapse into a smaller time window. The probability of occurrence can also be dependent on a lot of other features like location proximity, dependencies etc..

Let's say everything is a task, including events.

## What is a task?

Let's see what are properties of a task according to me

-   Time range in which it makes sense
-   Time range in which its actually happening
-   Frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, fixed days in a month)
-   location
-   link if its online
-   reminders around different mediums
-   dependent events (prep for an event does not make sense if the event is cancelled, right?)
-   Notion of progress & completion

Tasks can be categorized into facets since everyone has multiple facets in their life. Have a grouping strategy based on facets like life, work, volunteering etc..

Once we have this, we can zoom out. Let's see what apps solve for this in different ways

-   calendar (obviously)
-   task managers
-   habit trackers
-   project management

## Whats already in the market?
