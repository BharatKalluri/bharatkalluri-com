Feels sad when people fret over their financial positions, even people in the higher earning segment in india most of the times don't have a strong grip over their finances. I would say its essential to be aware of how to manage your hard earned wealth, similar to how you manage your health.

## The why

There is one sneaky part about wealth which unfortunately a lot of people don't have a intuitive understanding about, inflation.

Inflation: Inflation is a rise in prices over time, which causes purchasing power to decrease. Its the value purchase power of your money. Whatever you could have bought with a hundred rupees cannot be bought now, since the prices of those items have gone up. So technically if you have a lakh under your bed, year on year the lakh is losing its value even if you don't touch it.

This is one of the primary reasons you should have an arrangement where your money grows in numbers so that your absolute purchasing power at least remains the same. Remember that money is depreciating store of value.
