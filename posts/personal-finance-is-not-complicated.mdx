> We have sane defaults in a lot of worlds. Your computer comes with a sane default, your phone comes with a sane default, your employer has some fundamental & sane policy defaults. Where is the sane default for personal finance? You can do a complete body health checkup and get a health report every six months, where is the wealth report for the normal person? A default should be a good starting point into the rabbit hole, diving into the rabbit hole is fun, but not essential. This post aims to form a sane default for finance.

Feels sad when people fret over their financial positions, even people in the higher earning segment in india most of the times don't have a strong grip over their finances. I would say its essential to be aware of how to manage your hard earned wealth, similar to how you manage your health.

## Why should you care?

There is one sneaky part about wealth which unfortunately a lot of people don't have a intuitive understanding about, inflation.

### Inflation

Inflation: Inflation is a rise in prices over time, which causes purchasing power to decrease. Its the value purchase power of your money. Whatever you could have bought with a hundred rupees cannot be bought now, since the prices of those items have gone up. So technically if you have a lakh under your bed, year on year the lakh is losing its value even if you don't touch it.

This is one of the primary reasons you should have an arrangement where your money grows in numbers so that your absolute purchasing power at least remains the same. Remember that money is depreciating store of value.

### Emergency management

God forbid, but imagine something happens to one of your loved ones and there is a situation where a good amount of money is required for a operation. Families go into multi year debt traps in this situations. Having this sorted out is essential.

## In search of a sane default

### Step one: Understand current state, income and spends

Get a picture of how much is your income per month and how much is your expenditure per month. Unfortunately there is no super obvious way to do it as of now (account aggregators once matured are purported to solve this). So I would suggest move a fixed amount into a new bank account and use only that bank account for all spends and observe the start balance and end balance.

Once you get a picture, evaluate if there is any scope for optimizations. If you have left over post all expenses, great! You are in a good place! If not, see if there can be optimizations to solve for that. Decide on a monthly spend and stick to it. Make room for savings.

### Step two: Build a emergency fund

Save at least two months of your income into a savings account, eventually increase that fund to six months of earnings. In a hard situation, having finance as another source of tension is the last thing we want.

Save this into a savings account, don't worry about rate of return etc.. This is just so that you have the capacity to handle the financial stress if and only if something happens.

### Step three: Form a plan for getting rid of debts

Debts sometimes are unfortunately essential, figure out what it takes to get rid of debts and record the visibility. Evaulate if you have the convenience for that now, if not optimize to get there.
