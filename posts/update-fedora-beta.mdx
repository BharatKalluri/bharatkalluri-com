Make sure you system is up to date

```
sudo dnf --refresh upgrade
```

And install the system upgrade plugin for dnf

```
sudo dnf install 'dnf-command(system-upgrade)'
```

Now upgrade and download the latest release version files by running

```
sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=33
```

This will be a hugo download and will take some time. After this, finally run

```
sudo dnf system-upgrade reboot
```

This command will reboot and go through the installation phase. After a successfull installation, you will be running the latest fedora version. (In my case 33.)
