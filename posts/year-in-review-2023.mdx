Following the tradition of reflection at the end of the year as usual. Last post can be found [here](./year-in-review-2022). This is a public documentation of everything which went well, stuff which did not go well and everything in between.

## Writing

- Started working on one of my most / if not my most ambitious writing projects called [from scratch](https://fromscratch.bharatkalluri.com). It is a project on building everyday tech from scratch to have a deeper understanding & more mechanical sympathy.
- One interesting post on writing an [ESlint rule from scratch](./custom-eslint-rule), which did pretty well!
- Wrote a lot of notes on math, minimalism, one bag, key remapping, how bulk jobs should be handled etc.. [follow me on Twitter](https://x.com/bharatkalluri) where I post more notes.

## Code

Apart from the work related code at [Work](https://refyne.co.in).

- A lot of code prototyping for [from scratch](https://fromscratch.bharatkalluri.com). Its very hard to teach a concept with a good learning story or arc.
- Experimented with thought stream. An application where you can dump raw thoughts and later process them. This was also supposed to be a collection of life events (like 10 pushups, 2k run etc…), which ties into self-quantification. As I write this, I remembered what I was going for. Will again spend some time & make this public.
- Moved this website from chakra to tailwind css. It was a useful migration and let me customize elements further. Although chakra was the best choice for the beginning days when I had zero good sense in design. I hope I have some now.
- Worked with an NGO on parsing PDFs using Open AI. Was a fascinating experience and was positively mind-blown. Will use these APIs further in the products / projects I build.
- Started reading [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). Very grateful for this to exist, excellent book.

## Travel

Good year in terms of travel.

- Coorg, the zostel here is beautiful and the people are amazing. It has a fireplace where people sing, dance and celebrate life. Its a pleasure to be here every single time.
- Allepy: a week-long trip. Kerala is beautiful and a week was just about enough to experience the endless beauty of this miracle. One of the best places to visit if you want to relax & wind down. [Cafe Catamaran](https://www.instagram.com/cafecatamaran/) is a magical place, do visit.
- Varkala (solo), one more beautiful place from Kerala. Been in lost hostel (near the helipad). Very cool people, great vibe.
- Kolad (solo), the most peaceful place I've been to till now. I've been to the Zostel here. To reach the Zostel, you'll have to take a boat! Its located in the middle of a river! Sleeping on a hammock next to a river is bliss. Check it out!
- Goa: went thrice with different groups. Was my first time at goa in my life too. Goa although has been getting more and more main stream, the place has a magic which is hard to beat. I've been to a couple of hostels, all of them were pretty good. I guess I'll visit goa at least every year going forward.
- Paragliding at Panchgani. Awesome experience, highly recommended!

## Others

- Participated in Let's hack Bangalore run by [Obvious](https://www.obvious.in/), was a lovely experience. Won runners-up! Written about it [over here](./notes-from-lets-hack-bglr).
- Learnt some card tricks & cardistry. Was super fun, will probably spend some time on this too in the next year.
- Started going to [cubbon reads](https://twitter.com/cubbonreads), loved it. Will start going more next year.


## What did not go well

- **Treks**: None. [Last year](./year-in-review-2022) did two treks, this year it was zero. Need to get back up and do a couple this year.
- **Running & fitness**: Barely ran, mostly 2k's. Need to get back into fitness & running.

And that's a wrap! Here's to hoping all of us have great 2024!
