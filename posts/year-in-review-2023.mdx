Following the tradition of reflection at the end of the year as usual. Last post can be found [here](./year-in-review-2022). This is a public documentation of everything which went well, stuff which did not go well and everything in between.

## Writing

- Started working on one of my most / if not my most ambitious writing projects called [from scratch](https://fromscratch.bharatkalluri.com). It is a project on building everyday tech from scratch to have a deeper understanding & more mechanical sympathy.
- One interesting post on writing an [ESlint rule from scratch](./custom-eslint-rule), which did pretty well!
- Wrote a [lot of notes](https://bharatkalluri.com/notes) on math, minimalism, one bag, key remapping, how bulk jobs should be handled etc.. [follow me on Twitter](https://x.com/bharatkalluri) where I post more notes.

## Reading

[Read 10 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/41102048). Best fiction was "Tomorrow & Tomorrow & Tomorrow" and best non fiction was "Tell me how it ends". Did better than last year (I read 5 last year, so that bar's pretty low).

## Code

Apart from the work related code at [Refyne](https://refyne.co.in).

- A lot of code prototyping for [from scratch](https://fromscratch.bharatkalluri.com). Its very hard to teach a concept with a good learning story or arc.
- Won runner-ups in Let's hack Bangalore hackathon run by [Obvious](https://www.obvious.in/). Was a lovely experience, wrote more about it [over here](./notes-from-lets-hack-bglr).
- Worked with an NGO on parsing PDFs using Open AI. Was a fascinating experience and was positively mind-blown. Will use these APIs further in the products / projects I build.

## Travel

- Coorg: the zostel here is beautiful and the people are amazing. It has a fireplace where people sing, dance and celebrate life. Its a pleasure to be here every single time.
- Allepy: a week-long trip. Kerala is beautiful and a week was just about enough to experience the endless beauty of this place. One of the best places to visit if you want to relax & wind down. [Cafe Catamaran](https://www.instagram.com/cafecatamaran/) is a magical place, do visit.
- Varkala (solo): Been to lost hostel (near the helipad). Very cool folks, great vibe.
- Kolad (solo): the most peaceful place I've been to till now. I've been to the Zostel here. To reach the Zostel, you'll have to take a boat! Its located in the middle of a river! Sleeping on a hammock next to a river is bliss. Check it out!
- Goa: Was my first time at goa in my life. Went thrice this year. Goa although has been getting more and more main stream, the place has a magic which is hard to beat.
- Panchgani: Went paragliding. Awesome experience, highly recommended!

## Others

- Learnt some card tricks & cardistry. Was super fun, will probably spend some time on this too in the next year.
- Started going to [cubbon reads](https://twitter.com/cubbonreads), loved it. Will start going more next year.

## What did not go well

- **Treks**: None. [Last year](./year-in-review-2022) did two treks, this year it was zero. Need to get back up and do a couple this year.
- **Running & fitness**: Barely ran, mostly 2k's. Need to get back into fitness & running.

And that's a wrap! Here's to hoping all of us have great 2024!
