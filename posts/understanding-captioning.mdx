Subtitles are one of those things which you might think is very simple and straight forward, but dive
in to the field to only realize it's a lot more complicated.

Fun fact, The word subtitle is the prefix sub- ("below") followed by title. In some cases, such as
live opera, the dialogue is displayed above the stage in what are referred to as
surtitles (sur- meaning "above").

## The SRT specification

`srt` files are one of the most popular captioning formats currently. All major video players support
srt files. If you have added subtitles to a video on VLC, it would have probably been a `srt` file.

The problem is that there is not established standard for `srt`. Here are the rules a `srt` file should
follow so that players can read them. First up, let us look at a sample

```
1
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,375
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:22,501
Very good, Lieutenant.
```

There are 4 rules an `srt` file is expected to follow

-   The first line should be an incrementing index
-   Immediately after that, there should be another line which contains two timestamps. in the format HH:MM:SS,MILLSEC
    separated by `-->`.
    Another fun fact, the reason the separator is comma is because the creators were based out of France!
-   After this, there can be one or more lines of text containing the actual contents of the caption
-   A new line is expected to be between each block

These blocks are also called as cues.

The spec sounds very simple, and it is. So, my initial idea is to implement a parser using just RegEx.
This is how that would look

```python
from pprint import pprint

CUE_BLOCK_REGEX = r'((?P<index>[0-9]+)\n)?(?P<start_time>[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}.[0-9]{3}) --> (?P<end_time>[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}.[0-9]{3})\n(?P<content>.*?)(\n\n|$)'

sub_to_parse = '''1
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,375
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:22,501
Very good, Lieutenant.'''

pprint([m.groupdict() for m in list(re.finditer(CUE_BLOCK_REGEX, sub, re.DOTALL))])
"""
[{'content': "Senator, we're making\nour final approach into Coruscant.",
  'end_time': '00:02:20,375',
  'index': '1',
  'start_time': '00:02:17,440'},
 {'content': 'Very good, Lieutenant.',
  'end_time': '00:02:22,501',
  'index': '2',
  'start_time': '00:02:20,476'}]
"""
```

## Parsing issues with Regex

Well, as I was saying. There is no formal specification surrounding `srt`. So different files follow
different structures. There is a great article on [blog.foolip.org](https://blog.foolip.org/2010/08/20/srt-research/)
which analyzed around 10000 `srt` files from open subtitles. Here are some highlights from that article

-   The ID line is mostly useless, some `srt` files skip it entirely
-   Assuming blank lines separate cue's turns out to be unreliable
-   The timestamps also do not seem to follow a specific format, the padding may not be proper. Assuming
    milliseconds to always be a 3 padded integer would probably cause issues.
    I do not intend on dealing with this in my implementation.
-   HTML tags could also be broken, there could be a \<b\> tag with no closing tag available.

I'm sure we can have a RegEx which can support all of these quirks and still extract cue data. I think
at that point, the RegEx solution will be much harder to read. So, I opted to write the parser in python
instead

## Round II: SRT parser in Python

> All the code for this is present on [Github](https://github.com/BharatKalluri/playground/tree/main/srt-parser)

Looks like Rule 1 (incrementing index) and Rule 4 (A new line after a cue) are not consistently followed.
So, let us ignore those and try building a parser. Two points which we can depend on are that

-   There will be a line which will have `-->` which will contain start and end timestamps
-   Right after this, there will be **one or more** lines of content

Here is the game plan, filter all empty lines and filter all the lines with numbers (lines with the ID).
After that, we will be left with just the lines having timestamps followed by content. Now, group by
the lines with the timestamps, and the output will be just alternate blocks of timestamps and content.

Now, it is just a matter of putting these blocks together to get the cue objects.

Before this, let us create a class called `CueBlock`

```python
from utils import convert_str_time_to_timestamp_in_ms


class CueBlock:
    def __init__(
            self, index: int, start_time_str: str, end_time_str: str, content: str
    ) -> None:
        self.index = index
        self.start_time = convert_str_time_to_timestamp_in_ms(start_time_str)
        self.end_time = convert_str_time_to_timestamp_in_ms(end_time_str)
        self.content = content.strip()

    def to_json(self):
        return {
            "index": self.index,
            "start_time": self.start_time,
            "end_time": self.end_time,
            "content": self.content,
        }
```

We are also importing a helper function which converts string timestamp into milliseconds.

Some helper functions before we get started

```python
from typing import Iterator


def convert_str_time_to_timestamp_in_ms(time_str: str) -> int:
    split_on_comma = time_str.split(",")
    ms = int(split_on_comma[1])
    hours, minutes, seconds = map(int, split_on_comma[0].split(":"))
    return ms + (seconds * 1000) + (minutes * 60 * 1000) + (hours * 60 * 60 * 1000)


def is_line_with_timestamps(line_contents: str) -> bool:
    return '-->' in line_contents


def str_iter_arr_to_single_line(str_iter: Iterator[str]) -> str:
    return '\n'.join([str(g) for g in str_iter])
```

Now, implementing the parser function

```python
def get_cue_blocks_from_srt_string(srt_string: str):
    all_cue_blocks = []
    cue_count = count(0)

    srt_lines: [str] = srt_string.splitlines()
    filter_numbers: Iterator[str] = filter(lambda x: not x.isdigit(), srt_lines)
    filter_empty_lines: Iterator[str] = filter(lambda x: len(x) > 0, filter_numbers)

    groupby_iter: Iterator[tuple[bool, Iterator[str]]] = groupby(filter_empty_lines, is_line_with_timestamps)

    for key, group in groupby_iter:
        current_line = str_iter_arr_to_single_line(group)
        if is_line_with_timestamps(current_line):
            timestamp_data_str = current_line
            regex_matches: dict[str, str] = re.match(
                TIMESTAMPS_REGEX,
                timestamp_data_str,
                re.DOTALL
            ).groupdict()
            cue_contents = str_iter_arr_to_single_line(next(groupby_iter)[1])
            all_cue_blocks.append(
                CueBlock(
                    start_time_str=regex_matches.get('start'),
                    end_time_str=regex_matches.get('end'),
                    content=cue_contents,
                    index=next(cue_count)
                ).to_json()
            )

    return all_cue_blocks
```

Let us go through the code of `get_cue_blocks_from_srt_string` step by step

-   The input is the raw string from the `srt` file, the first step is to split them into lines
-   After that, we first filter out all the lines which just contain a number. These are the lines which contain ID's.
    We will be populating them manually later on.
-   Next, filter out empty lines. To skip all the new lines which are there to signify cue block end.
-   Now that we just have timestamps and content. We run a `groupby` on the array to form alternating blocks of timestamps
    and content. If this does not make sense, I suggest putting a print here and seeing what the output of `groupby` is.
-   Remember that `groupby` gives back an iterator, this will prove very useful very soon.
-   Now, get the current line (It will be an iterator of string, we join all those using new lines. This is because
    content can span multiple lines). If current line contains `-->` then it is a line which has timestamps.
-   If the current line contains timestamps, then the next block in the group by will contain content. So, we call `next`
    on the iterator to get the subtitle contents.
-   Now that we know the contents, and the timestamps line, it's just a matter of parsing the timestamps line using some
    regex's to figure out the start time and end time and make a CueBlock out of this information
-   And push all these CueBlock objects to an array. At the end, we return this `CueBlock`s array.

That's it! This is a basic `srt` parser.

## What more?

This is where the coding piece ends. I was curious to see how complicated captioning, and the software surrounding it is.

#### Subtitle formats

Subtitles are also called as timed tracks. And there are a lot of competing formats in this space. This is what happens
when there is no standard. Currently [there are over **50 competing formats!** ](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Timed_track_formats)
Looks like `srt` is the most popular between all of them, most probably because of its simplicity.

Some formats use frame numbers as a reference, this could be a huge problem since there will be the same video in
different frame rates and that could break the subtitles.

#### Additional features supported by different Captioning specifications

Also, positioning should be a part of the spec. Subtitles cannot be shown always at the bottom, if there is something
important going on at the bottom end of the screen. The sub will shadow that. As far as I know `srt` does not support this.

Another thing which needs to be included is the color. This can be achieved through html tags. Some players just do
it in white with a black back shadow. That seems to mostly work as well. All the
[media players need to support some level of HTML tags](https://ale5000.altervista.org/subtitles.htm).

#### Positioning and its importance

This gets more interesting, I thought the subtitles are usually either placed on the top or the bottom of the screen.
Looks like japanese subtitles are placed on the right and left ends of the screen instead of top or bottom.

#### Forced Narrative

All captions are not created equal. Imagine you are watching an english movie which has some parts in italian. Even
though the subtitles are switched off, Netflix will show subtitles for the parts which are in italian. This is called
as forced narrative.

This is decided by the movie-makers. If the character in the movie does not know the language, then the director can
choose not to show FN captions because they want you to see the world as the character sees it.

#### Captioning software

Of course there are services which will auto subtitle videos. For example, [Veed](https://www.veed.io/)

Captioning software is not cheap either, MacCaption starts from 1898$, and the enterprise edition goes up till
15525$. EZtitles starts from 1,720 € and goes up to 2,380 €.

#### Law

This blew my mind. Apparently there are laws surrounding captioning. It is a part of the "Americans with Disabilities"
act, "Rehabilitation Act" and "21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act" that captioning is mandatory!

That is the reason why all US material on Amazon Prime and Netflix etc have captions.
